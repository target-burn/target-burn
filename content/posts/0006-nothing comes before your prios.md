Building a business with a small team can feel like pushing a bunch of rocks up hill.

And I love working with my team now and small teams in general.

There are three things I remind myself about when it comes to solving problems and making things better.

1. Prioritization matters. Urgent and high impact gets done first. (Knowing who should do it is another topic.)
2. Most things that feel urgent, aren’t. Sometimes my to-do list grows and the things on the bottom of it don’t seem to matter anymore. Be ruthless when deciding what to work on. Instead of trying to do all the things, get rid of the ones that don't actually matter. Focus on the high impact work.
3. Everything can get better. Just not all at once. Traffic can go up. Conversions can increase. We can keep more customers. We can make it all better. Because we’re a small team, we have to pick one or two to fix now. We can't do it all at once. So, prioritization matters.
Small teams can do big things when we choose the right things to work on. For most businesses there can be a single focus.

Our current focus at Accoil is awareness that our product exists. It's new. When we have good awareness going, we'll improve how we capture leads. When we have leads working, we'll likely focus on how we sell.

Then the cycle will then repeats. But the whole way, we have to focus on priorities.

MrBeast agrees: Nothing comes before your "prios"
