I am not judged by the number of times I fail, but by the number of times I succeed; and the number of times I succeed is in direct proportion to the number of times I can fail and keep on trying.
~Tom Hopkins

My good friend Jason says this to me a lot. I love this quote because it reminds of three things:

1. You and me, we earn our wins
2. Failing sucks, but it doesn't last long
3. Every win, big or small, becomes the new floor from which we operate

Nobody gets every marketing campaign right. Nobody builds the best product on the first go. Nobody nails that homepage copy in the first draft.

Everything we do is a test to see if it'll work. When it works, we get to test ourselves to see if we can make it work some more or better.

I also believe that the ratio of fails to successes gets better if we keep trying.

Keep swinging,
