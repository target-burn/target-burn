Marcus resigned from his job after only 9 months. It wasn't what he thought it would be. He felt let down by what he called 'the chaos'.

Have you ever looked at another company and thought "Yeah, they have it all together"?

Have you also every felt like you, your team, your company live in "chaos"? Like you need to get your shit together?

If you ask me, Marcus was looking for a real life unicorn. There are no companies that magically have it all together. None. There is no magic formula for success.

Building a business, a team, or a product takes work. Work is messy. And this is true for everyone.

So if you (like me) sometimes wish you could build a perfectly run business, it's ok. You're not alone. In fact, you're in good company.

If you ever have a moment when it feels like there's no fixing things, hit reply to one of these emails and vent.

Keep going,

Peter

PS: I by no means have my shit together. And quite often its more fun when there's at least a little chaos.
