I wrote yesterday about getting on a plane to meet people. Another benefit of standing in front of someone is body language.

In-person selling doesn't scale well, but it's the fastest feedback we'll ever get.

When we're talking to the right person -- someone who can and should buy our product -- it's easy to see when a pitch resonates.

When we say the right words, two exciting things happen. Eyes widen and shoulders lean in.

When a pitch is even a little bit off, we get polite nods and "That's cool."

When we see the whites of their eyes, we know what works and what doesn't

Yeah, you can get a sense of this on Zoom. But it's not the same.

So this is me suggesting again to get on a plane, shake hands, make your pitch in person. Adjust your pitch until you see their eyes widen, their shoulders lean in, their wallet open ;)

Take what works and put it on the website, your socials, in your email signature, and run with it until you find a pitch that gets even more people excited.

It's a process (but it's pretty damn fun)
