AI is eating the world. And whether you like it or not, it's a hungry beast.

My co-founder Kate attended ​Intercom's​ big partner and customer event.

Intercom is going all in on AI. They launched a new AI customer support agent named Fin. Fin is not an LLM. It's not trained on the web. It's trained on the documentation, knowledgebase, and other content we feed it.

For Fin to work best, it needs us to write down as much as we can about our software. It needs the technical side. It needs to use cases and workflows we enable. It needs to know how we work, our policies and procedures. Terms and Conditions, privacy policies, and maybe even contracts are all fair game.

To make AI tools work for us (you and me and our businesses) I think we'll come to rely on three modalities:

* Tools like ChatGPT and Claude that work on LLMs and have broad skillsets. Anyone can buy a license and use these tools.
* Focused tools like Copy.ai and ​Ironclad​ that provide specific skills (copywriting and contract management respectively). They blend LLM plus user input.
* Internal AI tools trained on only what we provide them. This is entirely our input.

**#3 is important.**

It sometimes feels like a generic AI blob will take over the world. If everyone uses ChatGPT to write blog posts, we get a lot of same-same blog posts. Meh.

A generic AI blob means nobody offers anything different. To some extent, tools like Copy.ai can even produce similar stuff.

An AI tool trained on how you think, on what only you know to be true, is unique. This amplifies your voice and, more importantly, your unique value.

**So write it all down.**

The more we record, the more our own AI tools get to know us. What's cool is that "write that down" doesn't mean writing. Not necessarily.

Ironically, we can use AI to help record everything.

1. Record a Loom video. It's transcribed automatically.
2. Use Otter.ai for a voice recording with transcript and summary.
3. Or just write without worrying about grammar, spelling, syntax, whatever. AI will get it.

**Leverage your superpower.**

That's really what I'm talking about. You have a superpower. You can amplify it with AI, but you have to get it out of your head and into a format AI can learn from.

Tools like Fin are only as good as the info we give them. So why not make them as good as we can?

To do that, we'll have to get into the habit of writing everything down. Build a culture of writing, recording, and capturing ideas. It will be a huge part of how we deliver value.
