Speed.

That's what we talk about when we talk about AI. In particular, for the marketing and sales side of things. **We talk about speed**:

* Speed to produce content.
* Speed to create new ideas.
* But also the speed we might be left behind if we don't learn how to use this stuff.

To keep pace and to build a nimble marketing capability, we're trying a new thing. I created a Jira* project called Marketing Tests. It's simple. There's a list of ideas to test. A list of experiments we're running right now. And one list for things that worked and one for things that didn't.

Ideas can be big or small. But the experiments must be small. An experiment has to be simple enough to be built and started in one day. Measuring results can take a while, but it's important to me that we launch quickly so we can learn as fast as possible.

**Where do we find the time?**

We haven't until recently. Starting this month, we're setting aside one day to experiment. I plan to run this for a few months and see how we go.

**Focusing on AI**

My challenge to the team is to use AI. We're a small team, but I think we can do a lot with the help of AI tooling. These experiments should include some AI in an attempt to either shorten our workflows OR create new ones.

One day a month doesn't feel speedy. Maybe we'll follow Google and go for 20% Time (or one day a week) to experiment and built new things.

But for now, we're starting with one day to see what kind of impact it has.

**What about you?**

Are you finding ways to leverage AI? If you are, how? And what tools do you use? If not, why not?
