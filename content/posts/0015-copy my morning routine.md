Spoiler Alert: I have no morning routine. We have four kids and a cat who take turns making sure no morning routine takes hold.

But seriously, here are two things that helped me get over all the morning routine porn online:

1. Nobody is judging my morning. Only me. So I stopped judging my 'routine' and instead aimed to do something simple. That is...
2. Reading. Reading is meditation for me.

I believe in just-in-time learning. When I start a new role - read about it. When I start a new project - read about it.

Books. Articles. Newsletters. Whatever.

Reading is the only thing that I feel I *must* do every day. And 5 out of 7 days a week, I can do it.

But don't actually copy my morning routine. There isn't one. But if you do one thing in the morning, try learning something that will help you do your job today.

Ciao for now,

Peter
