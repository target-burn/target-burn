There are days when I think we're doomed.

As we build (and launch) Accoil Analytics, there are days when it feels like we're trying to push a boulder up a ski slope.

There's too much competition. There's too much to do. There's no way we're going to make it work. People aren't going to pay for this thing!

But then I have a sales call booked or a demo to do. I have to be on. I need to have faith that not only is it going to work, it's going to be amazing.

It's a funny thing, faith. It's one of those BIG things that we often avoid talking about, right? But it doesn't have to be big. It can be little. And it can be all you need to make things work.

If you have a moment when even that little faith is hard to come by, hit reply to one of these emails. I read and respond to every reply.
