A tool recommendation:

We started using Otter.ai to record, transcribe, summarize, and share action items from meetings.

I'm generally skeptical of new AI tools ability to *actually* save time. But Otter works. And it's not just meetings.

* Accurate summaries makes it easy for leaders and other teams to get up to speed without being on Zoom calls

* Action items are recorded, assigned, and even put in the tools where they need to be (so actions don't just sit on a meeting minutes page nobody will ever read :)

* Record voice notes in the mobile app after a long day of networking, selling, etc. at a conference (I'm doing this every day this week)

Some friends are building a similar tool called Spinach.io and we're going to give it a try too. Yes, both tools cost a bit to unlock their real power. But when I stack up the time saved and important actions not missed, it's worth it and then some.

G'day ðŸ‘‹
