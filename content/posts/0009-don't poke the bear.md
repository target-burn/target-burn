You may be different. I'm hardwired to jump in when a conversation goes quiet.

The same is true when it comes to bringing new customers into our business. If it's quiet for too long, I have this urge to "re-engage." It could be an email, an SMS, or a not-so-subtle popup on our website.

Some of the best advice I've ever gotten on engaging with customers came from a comment line buried in some code.

It's this:

"If an account is doing everything right and they'll buy from you even if you don't talk to them, don't poke the bear."

Sometimes it's best to stay out of the way. Let motivated customers work. Let them come to to you instead of being the one to always "re-engage."
