There's only one way to stay sharp and on top of our game. Whether it's copywriting, sales, or giving feedback.

As a good friend recently said to me, it's:

**"Practice. Drill. Repeat. PDR"**

There are parts of every role that I could always get better at.

I'd like to be a better copywriter.

My PDR for copywriting is copywork. Copywork is the practice of handwriting the best ads, sales letters, and website copy I can find.

I need to be a better sales person.

My sales PDR is writing a script and doing role play. As much as I hate (HATE) role play, it works. Team up with someone at work. Practice the script a few times. Get feedback. Keeping drilling.

It's amazing how quickly skills can go dull. Thankfully we can sharpen them quickly.

**Practice. Drill. Repeat.**

Or as Honest Abe said:

Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.
As a leader in your business, which pieces of your work could you PDR? Hit reply and let me know.

Stay sharp,

Peter
