Berkshire Hathaway's website is basic: https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/​

Sometimes, I look at it as a reminder that it's ok to share only what's needed.

Should we all copy it. Nope. You and I, we should not copy it.

Why?

* Our websites need to educate and sell and sell some more. But it's good to ask if a site has more than it needs.
​
* Even companies that build sites to look 'retro' have to be sharp. Even a 'no design' website has to be well designed to convert. Berkshire doesn't sell anything, so design doesn't matter.
​
* Not giving a damn is not an option. Berkshire gets away with it because it comes across as a folksy / focused lack of resources spent on a trivial website. We need to try and look like we're trying.

Worth wondering,
