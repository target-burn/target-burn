Teams often face the same hurdles, dilemmas, and decision-points over and over again.

To make it easier for everyone to make decisions that keep us moving, we came up with five rules for everyone to better manage themselves.

These rules let everyone make decisions without needing approval for every little thing.

The rules don't mean we can't ask questions. I love questions. If we need to talk, we talk. The rules help everyone move fast and build momentum.

Here they are, with minimal edits:

1 - Perfect is the enemy of progress
Sometimes we need to press publish when something is good enough.

“Good enough” doesn’t mean low quality. It means we do our best within the time constraints we have.

If you find yourself pushing to get something 100% right, stop and consider if it’s good enough. If it is, send it.

2 - Bias for action with enough information
We’re building a company based on trust. As we work together, that trust will grow. Remember that with your role comes an expectation of autonomy and responsibility to get shit done.

If you have enough information to make a sound decision, go for it.

Do first. Apologize later.

3 - A momentum budget
If you get stuck on a project or piece of work and need a little bit of money to unblock you, spend it. You are pre-authorized to spend up to US$100 to keep momentum going.

Let’s have a bias for action. If a small amount of money will keep you moving, buy what you need and keep going.

4 - Ask Who not How
If you have to ask “How will I get this done?” and your answer is “I’ll just do it myself” then take a moment to ask:

Who is the best person to do this?

We’re a team. Is someone else able to do it better, faster, on time? Sometimes you’re not the right person to do a job and that’s ok.

5 - You own your calendar
You can say no to calls, meetings, and things that don’t help you do your work.

We’re all working to grow Accoil, so if someone needs your help and needs to meet, go do that. But guard your time. Prioritize your work. Say no when any request for your time gets in the way of your priorities.

I'm always learning to be a better manager and teammate. Reply and tell what tips or tricks do you use to keep your teams moving?

Hasta mañana,

Peter
