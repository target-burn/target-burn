Who do you want to meet that would change the course of your business?

If you're not willing to get on a plane to meet them in person, you're missing a huge opportunity.

I'll save you all the terrible analogies (including the one about online dating vs meeting in real life).

Meeting someone. Shaking his or her hand. Breaking bread across a table. It creates a connection you will never get from LinkedIn comments.

It may feel like a lot of money to book a flight, pay for a hotel room, get the bill for dinner.

But while your competitors build the "best" product, confident people will flock to them like some Field of Dreams, you're looking your customers in eye. And you're closing deals because you put the effort in to meet there exactly where they are.

We built a business by getting on planes and being in the same room as our customers. We're doing it again with Accoil.

We find where our best customers are. We go there.

So, who could you meet that would change the course of your business? And where are you willing to go to meet them?

Safe travels,

Peter
