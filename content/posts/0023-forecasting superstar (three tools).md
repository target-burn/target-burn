Running a business without budgeting and forecasting is like flying blind.

Here are two resources I use (plus one I'd like to try) to keep Accoil Analytics on track:

1. We use ​Causal​ to build sophisticated forecasts and budgets. This isn't for the faint of heart. Starter templates help you get going. Tailoring models to your business or unit can take a while. Still, it's a powerful tool.

2. I use Taylor Davidson's templates at ​​Foresight.is​​. Taylor offers a ton for free (amazing value) to get you started. Even if you're not the owner or CFO, these models teach you how to think like one.

3. Automation is great. ​​Equals.com​​ is a new kind of spreadsheet tool that connects to many of the financial tools we all use. I haven't used it yet, but it's on my radar. It's more familiar than Causal, being a spreadsheet.

Time savings is what excites me about tools like Equals and Causal. There's a bit of setup needed, but once data is flowing I get accurate always-on financials.

Manually updating spreadsheets helps me remember important numbers. But automated tools are always up-to-date and easy to share across leadership.

If you're running a business or just want to understand what leadership thinks about, start at Foresight.is.

To becoming a forecasting superstar,
