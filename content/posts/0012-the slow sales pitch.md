I have to sell ideas to my teammates. Or else we as a company won't do them.

Sometimes the best sales pitch to my partners has been to simply do the thing until it proves its worth.

I pitched a weekly dashboard to track revenue, website visits, and other important metrics. You may think "of course you should have a dashboard for that stuff." But my proposal was to update it by hand. No automation.

"Waste of time," I was told.

But by forcing myself to check stats tab-by-tab and update a spreadsheet by typing in the numbers, I remember them.

I can chirp our revenue and even bank balances without thinking. So, the idea of manually updating the dashboard slowly caught on.

Why share this? Not to say you should manually update dashboards (but it works). It's this:

Don't always pitch. If you believe it will work, just do the thing.

When it starts working, teammates will notice and join in.
