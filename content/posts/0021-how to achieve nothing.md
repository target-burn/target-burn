If you just set out to be liked, you will be prepared to compromise on anything at anytime, and would achieve nothing.
-- Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of the UK.

I don't know if anyone needs to hear that today. It's ok to do things that are good for your business but may make some people not like you.

In fact, it's more than ok. It's the only way to grow a business or a product or even personally.

Say no to a proposal even when you really like the team behind it
Stop a teammate's pet project that doesn't add value
Let go a teammate who isn't working out
That doesn't mean it's ok to act like an asshole. Kindness still matters.

It also doesn't mean we're responsible for how someone chooses to react. If you and I behave like adults and show empathy and respect when making tough decisions, how others choose to respond is up to them.

Thatcher, aka The Iron Lady, also said "When I'm out of politics I'm going to run a business, it'll be called rent-a-spine."

I think I like Margaret Thatcher.
