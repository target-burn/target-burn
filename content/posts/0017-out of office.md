I wish I remembered who told me to try this. I'll paraphrase the advice:

There are a lot of customer touch points we all ignore. Add a little personality to them and see what happens.

And from that advice, I started updating my Out of Office AutoReply in Gmail. My AutoReplies were always very business-y and stodgy.

Now I write things like this:



No matter how many times I do this, there's always at least one person who writes back with a smile. It happened again this week.

What are some moments (big or small) that could use a little spark? It can be the smallest of things, but if it deepens even one relationship.... it's worth it.

Write me back if you want any help finding those little moments.
