There are times when good enough has to be what the world sees.

But rarely does the world know which version they're seeing.

If you've gone to a wedding, there's the wedding the bride and groom planned and there's the wedding that everyone experiences.

I've never been part of a webinar that didn't have a few technical hiccups.

Every website launch has last-minute scrambles before go-live.

We have to do the best work we can up to that moment when our plans meet the world. In that moment we have to remember how close we are to what we're building.

Nobody else sees the flaws or inspired touches with the same level of detail. But if we do good work, we also have to say "Ok, go."

Sending these emails was an "Ok, go" moment for me. I'm grateful for you reading them. I'm also grateful that you don't see the first drafts ;)

So, if you're sitting on something - a project of any kind - waiting for the exact right moment to launch, ask yourself if it's good enough.

Then launch that sucker.
